# Sorting Algorithm 
Students and staff can voice their opinions for the new advisory groups via two Google Forms. These forms generate thousands of datapoints. This small program is our effort to transparently meet as many of those requests as we can. 

### All Student Names have been excluded from this repo

## NetworkX and Python-Louvain libraries being used
A school is a social network. This program experiments with using the algorithms that help us understand digital social networks, but applied to this IRL dataset. Visual graphs represent self-calibrated partitions, based on survey data. Program creates roster lists for entry into school register.

#### Real Data excluded
The data to be processed by this small program should be in a folder called 'real-data' and needs some specific formatting. It has been excluded here, for privacy of members of our community. Read the details of the code, and you'll be able to construct the Google Forms style surveys to match requirements.
